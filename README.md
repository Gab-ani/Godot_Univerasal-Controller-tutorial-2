The code for a part II of character controller tutorial series. In this part we are moving from a "walking" and "jumping" capsule to an animated humanoid character which actually can only walk and sprint for this time. That can seem like a loss in functional, but this is a very theory-heavy epizode laying ground for a stellar part three. I have an opinion that Godot users don't have a strong understanding of what their engine true potential is. And the animation frameworks usage is illustrating it very good. This epizode main goal is to open watchers eyes on some universal software truths, which, if embraced, can in one second explain some topics that are very difficult to understand if you try to do it inside "game development bubble".
